"""Laya as a reranker: one typed question per (query, passage), zero-shot.

Two formulations are run on identical data, because nobody has published which
one ranks better and the second pass is cheap:

  score  an ordered list of rungs, irrelevant to directly-answers; rank by the
         expected position on that scale (0 to 4 here)
  noul   no criteria at all, one probability back; rank by that probability

Both run against two checkpoints out of the same weights folder arena uses
(arena/models/laya), loaded the same way: the base English one, and the
`typed-decisions` fine-tune that Convai's model card says is where the
capability on typed decisions actually comes from.
